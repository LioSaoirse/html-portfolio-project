<h1>The Bestest Shows para moi</h1>
<h2>My top THREE Shows of....ALL TIME</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I have always loved Sophie's chracter transformation, and the subtle undertones of society. Miyazaki is an amazing creator. </p>
<h3>MASH</h3>
<P>With the current polarization and modern issues, it really demonstrates how these issues ave been around a long time. And the intro is hella nostalgic.</P>
<h3>TIE Parks and Rec and That 70s Show and 30 Rock</h3>
<p>Let's be real, I can't stick with only 3. But these are my comfort repeat watches for general background enjoyment.</p>
